 Mid-term 1 Guidelines

This will be a closed book examination.

Please note that partial marks will be
given for partial work.


Topics to be covered in mid-term 1

1. Basic concepts of Information Retrieval Systems
   * Architecture of IR systems 
   * Binary user judgments (i.e., relevant vs nonrelevant documents)

2. Sample IR Systems:
   * Google, Google Scholar
   * Web of Science
   * DBLP 

3. Boolean retrieval models

4. System evaluation based binary user judgments
   (i.e., relevant and nonrelevant documents) and 
   binary system results (retrieved and non-retrieved
   documents).
   * recall
   * precision
   * recall-precision graph (with respect to ranked system results)
   * F measure

5. Indexing theory
   * Construction of indexing vocabulary (i.e., a set of index terms)
   * Term weighting (i.e., term frequency, term document frequency, and
     inverse document frequency, etc.)

6. System modeling and evaluation based on user preferences (i.e., preference relations)
   * Weak order
   * Order preserving utility functions
   * perfect ranking
   * acceptable ranking
   * performance measure based on distance between user and system rankings.

You need to understand both conceptual understanding and computational
methods.  That is, based on definitions of various notions, you should be
able to compute various quantities, such as recall, precision, recall-precision
graph, ndpm etc.

Sample questions

1. Give the basic architecture of IR systems and explain the functionality
   of each model.

2. Give the definition of precision and recall measures.  Explain the meaning
   of these measures.

3. Suppose that for a query q there are 10 relevant documents.  Consider the
   following ranking produced by a system:
        - + + - - + - + + - - - + - + + - - + + ...
   where + denotes a relevant document and - denotes a nonrelevant document.
   Draw the recall-precision graph

4. Describe the main ideas of Boolean retrieval model.  Discuss potential
   difficulties with Boolean model.

5. Provide an argument to show that binary user judgment is too restrictive.

6. Describe the basic ideas of inverse document frequency of a term.  Give
   two formulas to computing inverse document frequency.

7. Give the definition of a weak order.

8. Give the definition of an equivalence relation.

9. Why do we need that a user preference relation is a weak order.  What
   is the implications of a weak order.

10. Prove that if a preference relation is a weak order, then it is transitive.

11. Give the definition of a irreflective binary relation. Give a definition
   of asymmetric binary relation.  Prove that asymmetry implies ifflexivitity.

12. Describe the ideas of ndpm.
